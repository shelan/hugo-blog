I have lost twice and yes it is not a great position to be. But these two incidents had two different implications. When i lost my first phone it was a nokia phone (N71 to be exact) which was quite a smart phone at that time around 2007. Yes i wanted to find the phone but could not the story was over and life went on. But... &amp;nbsp;Second time i lost a Nexus 4 which is android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the big deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Oh my gmail account&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i sensed for the first time that i have lost my mobile phone the first thing that came to my mind was &#34;oh gosh all my accounts are there&#34;. But fortunately i have thought about this topic before i lost this phone so the next steps to be done was obvious to me. I think you might be interesting and you may have better suggestions as well. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three important things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Android phone has your email account , If you use gmail as the primary account then you might use gmail for most of other online accounts as well. (Facebook , twitter, ebay so on...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if anyone can get hold of it then you are doomed, Because anyone can use forgot my username or password reset features to take control of other account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Android phone has all your data :). In this what google does not back up. I think only your life which cannot be backed up restore later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) If your phone is not pin protected or not protected with any other mechanism then you are at the highest level of vulnerability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So what I should do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Change your email address password immediately. This is very crucial and the most important step&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check login history here. If there is a recent login just after you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?pli=1&#34;&gt;https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?pli=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) You should visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager&#34;&gt;https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager&lt;/a&gt;. Using this you can erase your mobile phone data (or in other words do a remote wipe out of data).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will only happen if the device is online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to locate the device you need to do it before the wipe out using the same above link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) You may register a police complaint at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the phone is more important. But for someone who needs to protect data, other accounts and also privacy above mentioned steps becomes vital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have other suggestions please do share in comments :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
