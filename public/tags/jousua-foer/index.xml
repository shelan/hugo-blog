      <description>&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.shelan.org/2015/02/do-we-need-to-master-memory-in-googles.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; i discussed about the importance of developing a most important gift a human has inside his brain.... the memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this world we have externalized most of the important stuff to external digital world. In a way it has made things evolving faster. We are gathering much more knowledge than earlier. Wait.. Is it knowledge or knowledge pointers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most suitable word is knowledge pointers using which we can retrieve knowledge easily. Imagine a world without internet or any other form of knowledge reference. How far can we survive.? We are loosing our capability of retaining information in our brains day by day and making the external storages cost effective at an similar pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am striving to regain that capability if i have lost and see how far i can succeed. Because following video will be one of your eye openers if you are one of the crazy people how would like to travel back to history and master one of the key aspects of a perfect Human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Ted talk which you will be fascinated to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;There are people who can quickly memorize lists of thousands of numbers, the order of all the cards in a deck (or ten!), and much more. Science writer Joshua Foer describes the technique — called the memory palace — and shows off its most remarkable feature: anyone can learn how to use it, including him&#34;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; class=&#34;YOUTUBE-iframe-video&#34; data-thumbnail-src=&#34;https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/U6PoUg7jXsA/0.jpg&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/U6PoUg7jXsA?feature=player_embedded&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
