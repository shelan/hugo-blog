      <description>&lt;div dir=&#34;ltr&#34; style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; trbidi=&#34;on&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp; It has been a week since i have became a student once more in my life. I like the experience of recreating the feelings that i had when i was a student ago two years back. Since now this blog is full of technical content and i did not have much time to blog much about my other experiences. But now this is a new life so thought of doing the same to my blog. Lets see how the new story unfolds...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/joint/emdc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EMDC&lt;/a&gt; ( European Masters in Distributed Computing) student at IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in Sweden. This offering is great not only because of the content it offers but the cultural experience you will gain. It is a bonus..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first week I was fortunate to visit some of the very beautiful places in Lisbon. I should say the coastal area is really fantastic even though i am coming from a place with full of beaches covering my beautiful island Sri Lanka. I will post more about that place in another post with more details.. and of course with pictures. Till then Just relax with the view out of my apartment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/10662141_10152378216449537_7174922840836620794_o.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;379&#34; src=&#34;https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/10662141_10152378216449537_7174922840836620794_o.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
